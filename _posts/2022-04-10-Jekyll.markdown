I've decided to create an entertainment blog using Github pages, Jekyll, and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
