An entertaining low-key movie about cousins trapped in the gangster life starring Matthias Schoenaerts and Joel Kinnamen.  I liked Schoenaerts in The Drop with Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini and Noomi Rapace, so I thought I'd check this one out.  It's not a great movie, but something to pass the time.  It's a bit of a slow burn with a nice little build of tension that tests loyalty to family against morale good.  A nice little movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
