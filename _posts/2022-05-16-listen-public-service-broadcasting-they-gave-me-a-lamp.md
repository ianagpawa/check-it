I stumbled upon Public Service Broadcasting in early 2022 and they've become a defining part of my year, musically.  They're a London-based instrumental band and each song I've found has somehow been better than the last.  The first was Go!, then The Other Side, then White Star Liner, and ROYGBIV, but I must say my favorite is definitely They Gave Me A Lamp. There's something about their arrangements that evokes a strong response within my core that it almost puts me in a trance-like state.  It's one of the songs that helps me truly let go and focus on being present in the moment.  I'm not sure if its the cyclical nature to the rhythm and structure, or if I'm just a sucker for a drawn out build up and good trumpets, but it strangely motivates me to try to be a better person.  Equally good for coding and meditation; leave on a loop for maximum effect.
