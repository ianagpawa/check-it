Surprisingly good movie in that it was even better than I expected.  I've been a fan of Benecio del Toro ever since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the rest of the cast is spectacular, especially Justin Timberlake and the ever graceful Alicia Silverstone.  The pacing, directing, and the use of music was spectacular, contributing to its brooding atmosphere. It reminded me of the movie Prisoners, and both of these movies follow a very David Fincher-esque style of revealing little nuggets of truth, slowly reeling you into the story and peering into the souls of the characters.
