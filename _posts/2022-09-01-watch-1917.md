I didn't like Dunkirk.  I thought it was trying too hard and was taking itself too seriously to the point of being unbearable.  I stopped watching somewhere before the middle; it just wasn't compelling enough; it felt more like a disjointed art piece.

In contrast, I found 1917 to be amazing.  The movie is basically composed of one-shots.  At first, it was a bit fatiguing, but the pacing of it was done extremely well along with the cinematography.  The story is very basic; war, war never changes.  Two soldiers have to go into enemy territory and deliver a message.  The flow of the movie done in real time captures a weird magic about the frenzy of combat.  I also liked that were was minimal backstory and context of the two main characters.  They were just blank slates, but throughout the movie, you develop a connection with them by understanding who they are through their actions and choices.

Really great visuals, good mood, pacing and atmosphere, and really compelling.  Definitely worth a watch.
