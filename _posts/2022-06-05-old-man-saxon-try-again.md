I've heard a few of songs from Old Man Saxon before and liked them but this one really resonates with me for some reason.  I've been going studying pretty consistently after work and on the weekends.  I think it mirrors my mindset currently: just keeping my head down and moving on.  I like that the video is also a little odd, which is very Old Man Saxon.  There's something about being alone in a whole club, and in a suit, just eating a burger that reall vibes with me.
