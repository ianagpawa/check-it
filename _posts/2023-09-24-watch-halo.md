I had my doubts about this show since I've heard a lot of negative reviews,
but it's honestly not that bad.  A bit of a deviation from the Master Chief in 
the vide games but for a show adaptation hoping to reel in a broad audience,
it's not the worst thing in the world.  It's an interesting glimpse int he Halo
Universe through the lense of a different medium; worth trying out fors an episode
at least.
